# recursion-TOP
This is a part of The Odin Project curriculum on recursion.

In this exercise I practiced using recursion to solve simple tasks.
I learned about Merge Sort as well as some other types of alghorithm.
Compared different alghorithms, their pros and cons.

Wrote my own implementation of Merge Sort alghorith.

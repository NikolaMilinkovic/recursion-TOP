# Recursion Practice
This is a part of The Odin Project curriculum on recursion.<br>
In this exercise I practiced using recursion to solve simple tasks. I learned about Merge Sort as well as some other types of alghorithm. Compared different alghorithms, their pros and cons.<br><br>

Wrote my own implementation of Merge Sort alghorith.<br>

## Features
- Itterative and Recursive binary search algorithm
- Fibbonaci
- Linear Search algorithm
- Merge Sort algorithm
- Many different smaller tasks solved via recursion

**ðŸ§­ Possible Future Implementations**
- Visual representation of Searching / Sorting algorithms
